# ClickRepeater
A simple "ClickRepeater" written in the script language AutoIt.

Basically it's an "Auto Clicker" with more functions. You registers mouse clicks (left or right) as you like on any location on your screen in your order of execution. 

SHIFT + 1 to register a left click on your current cursor position.

SHIFT + 2 to register a right click on your current cursor position.

SHIFT + 3 to play the stack you created.

SHIFT + 4 to stop your stack.

You can resett your stack with the reset button in the GUI or with SHIFT + 5.

If you need more than 100 clicks saved in your stack, all you have to do is increase the array size of the stack and index pointer in the source code.
